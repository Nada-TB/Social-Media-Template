```plaintext
social-media-template/
├── index.html            # Main HTML file for the template
├── style.css             # CSS styles for layout and design

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Challenge**: Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
- **Challenge**: Implementing a dynamic gradient background effect using JavaScript. This involved learning how to manipulate the Canvas API and applying gradients in real-time.
- **Learning**: Gained experience in creating dynamic and interactive elements using vanilla JavaScript and CSS media queries. The gradient effect added a modern touch and improved the visual appeal of the template.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance UI/UX design with additional styling and animations
- Add more interactive features such as user authentication and dynamic content loading
- Implement a backend for managing user data and interactions
- Optimize the gradient effect for better performance and visual appeal
